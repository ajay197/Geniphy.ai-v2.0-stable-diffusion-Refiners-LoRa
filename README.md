# Geniphy AI v2.0

**Geniphy AI v2.0** is a state-of-the-art generative AI model for image creation, leveraging advanced techniques such as Stable Diffusion, refiners, and LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation). This model provides enhanced control, improved quality, and creative versatility, making it ideal for artistic content generation and other applications.

---

## **Features**

- **Stable Diffusion**: Utilizes the Stable Diffusion backbone for efficient and high-quality image generation.
- **Refiner Models**: Enhances image details and optimizes the output for realism or stylization.
- **LoRa Fine-Tuning**: Enables fine control over specific model aspects and domain adaptation.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Allows users to configure image styles, resolutions, and artistic effects.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes built-in visualizations for intermediate results and debugging.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Geniphy_AI_v2.git
   cd Geniphy_AI_v2
   ```

2. **Pretrained Models**:
   Download the Stable Diffusion, refiner, and LoRa weights from the official sources and place them in the designated `/models` directory.

3. **Additional Setup**:
   Ensure you have CUDA-compatible hardware and the required drivers for GPU acceleration.

## **Usage**

1. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open and execute the `Geniphy_ai_v2_0.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

2. **Input Configuration**:
   - Define the desired image prompts, styles, and parameters.
   - Adjust LoRa weights or enable refiners for specific tasks.

3. **Generate Images**:
   Execute the generation pipeline to produce high-quality images.

4. **Save or Display Outputs**:
   Generated images can be saved locally or displayed directly in the notebook.
